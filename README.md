## User story

As a end-user, I want to see an eCommerce application that displays products, can filter by category, can search by name and description, and can filter by product availability

## The challenge

- Create a page that will use the available services to display products

- The products should be displayed in a list, and can be filtered by the following criteria:
  - Category
  - Availability
  - Search by name and description

- The application should use RxJS and reactive programming patterns to display and update elements

- Use component structure with a smart/dumb component approach in mind

## Extra

- If time allows, create a product details page that will show all the product information
